# PythonNumberGuesser
Just a standard number guesser in Python


The Python Number Guesser is just that. A number guesser game made in Python. The game allows you to select your range at the start. Many number guessers that have been
created do not include this option, but I like to think of it as a "choose your difficulty" kind of option.

This option includes a check to see if the range that is entered is less than or equal to 1. This is to ensure that the random number that is generated is not a single number; also that the number entered is not negative.

At the start, you are greeted with a welcome message that informs you to enter 0 while guessing to exit the game.

During your guessing, a running total is kept for the amount of tries you have gone through to guess the number. All the while you are informed if the number that you have guessed is too hight or too low.

Upon guessing the number, you are given a congratulations message along with how many tries you took trying to guess the number.

At the end of the game, you are prompted if you would like to play again. Upon accepting, you are prompted once again with what range you would like.
